# Fundamentals of Reinforcement Learning Experiments

Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to this repository dedicated to understanding the core concepts and algorithms of Reinforcement Learning (RL).

## Overview

Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a type of machine learning where an agent learns how to behave in an environment by performing actions and receiving rewards. This repo contains experiments and implementations of some fundamental RL algorithms to provide a deep dive into their inner workings.

## Algorithms Covered

- **Epsilon-Greedy**: A simple but effective method where the agent occasionally tries a random action (exploration), but most of the time chooses the action that it predicts will have the highest reward (exploitation).

- **Upper Confidence Bound (UCB)**: This algorithm deals with the exploration vs exploitation dilemma by choosing the action that has the highest upper confidence bound with respect to its estimated rewards. It's a way to balance the trade-off between trying out new things and sticking with what's known to work.

## Jupyter Notebooks ðŸ““

One of the highlights of this repo is the inclusion of Jupyter notebooks. These interactive notebooks provide a hands-on experience, allowing you to visualize and experiment with the algorithms in real-time.
